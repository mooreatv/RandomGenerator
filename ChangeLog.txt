- Moved random token UI out of DynamicBoxer into its own Addon

[...relevant changelog entries from DynamicBoxer...]
DynamicBoxer 1.1.0 June 13th 2019

- Added optional id/password generator, you can tab between the 2 copy/paste etc (can be used for channel
but mostly for the secret, it must be pasted on all windows, if copied, `/dbox random` to get just this utility)
(Issue #8) with lots of work/learning to get a cool fixed width narrow display and handle tab, escape, click, select,
typing etc as one may expect.
